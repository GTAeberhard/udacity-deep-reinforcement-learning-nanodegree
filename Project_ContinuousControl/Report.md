# Project Report

Author: Michael Aeberhard

This report summarizes the results of the second project, _Continuous Control_, of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement
Learning Nanodegree.

## The Reacher Environment

For this project, an agent with a two-jointed arm is trained to move the end of its arm into a moving target position
represented by a sphere in space.
